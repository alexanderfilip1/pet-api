        "This project is a full-stack application that includes a backend server built with Node.js, Express.js, React and a MySQL database for data storage. The server is designed to handle authentication, manage animal data, and serve images associated with different animals. A front-end interface is provided to interact with the server and demonstrate its functionalities.",

      title: "Authentication",
      content:
        "The application requires user authentication for accessing various routes. The `/api/signin` endpoint is used for signing in users. Additionally, a login page can be loaded via a `GET` request, where users can enter their credentials.",

      title: "Animal Data API",
      content:
        "The server provides an API to retrieve information about different animals, including `dogs`, `cats`, and `fish`. Depending on the request, the server either fetches data from an external API or from the local database:\n\n" +
        "- For `dogs`, data is fetched from the external `Dog CEO API`.\n" +
        "- For `cats` and `fish`, data is retrieved from the local database.\n\n" +
        "The endpoint `/api/animal/:animal` allows users to specify the type of animal and optionally retrieve a specific breed or a random one.\n\n" +
        "- If `random=1`, the `breed` parameter provided by the user will be ignored, and a random breed will be returned instead.",

      title: "Adding New Animals",
      content:
        "Users can add new entries for `cats` and `fish` to the database using the `POST /api/animal` endpoint. This includes uploading images, which are stored on the server. The application automatically generates the URL for the uploaded image and saves it along with the animal data.",

        "The project includes a SQL file that initializes the database, creates the necessary tables, and populates them with sample data. This ensures that the application can be easily set up and tested.",

      title: "Easy Setup",
      content:
        "The project is designed for easy deployment. After setting up the `MySQL` database using the provided SQL file, users only need to install dependencies and configure the database connection settings to get the application running.",

      content:
        "A React-based frontend is included to provide documentation and demonstrate how to interact with the server. The frontend includes a login form, buttons to fetch and display animal data, and a form for adding new animal entries. It also explains the serverâ€™s functionality, data sources, and system architecture.",
